About me:
===
I am a humanities graduate student turned data analyst who enjoys staying up later than he should to work.

About the site:
===

I built this site following the excellent little tutorial here: [http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/]

This is a useful reference for the version of markdown used on this site: [https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html]

Eventually, it would be nice to be able to embed Jupyter (or R) notebooks directly, without converting to html.  This might help: [https://cduvallet.github.io/posts/2018/03/ipython-notebooks-jekyll]
